### Canada Vs US Power Generation![](../Images/20250508211948.png)
- Majority of US power generation is coal.
- Majority of Canadian generation is Hydro
- Canada generates only 593.6 Terra Watt Hours of power
- USA generates 4,055 Terra Watt of power

### US/Canada power flow ![](../Images/20250508212029.png) ![](../Images/20250508212043.png)
- With traditional power generation, we have a large generation system and power flows through the loads. North American power systems are interconnected.
- Production in USA is much higher with around 4,055 Terra Watt Hours. Canada was only 500ish.
- Lots of interconnection between US and Canada. We are better connected North/South vs East/West.'
- There is now a push to go East/West that is being talked about.
- Import and export of power between US and Canada. Manitoba, Ontario, etc. export a large amount. BC, AB, SK, etc. import more than export.

### Power Imports/Exports Over Time![](../Images/20250508212146.png)
- Power generation has been fairly steady over time as seen in the chart, however, it is predicted to go up significantly in the near future because of recent technical developments.

### North American Reliability Council (NERC) ![](../Images/20250508212602.png)
- The original NERC was formed on June 1, 1968 by the electric utility industry to promote the reliability and adequacy of bulk power transmission in the electric utility systems of North America.
- The Electric Reliability Act of 1967, passed due to the political pressure and fallout from the 1965 blackout, was a significant turning point in the arena of electric reliability in North America.
- NERC's mission states that it is to "ensure that the bulk power system in North America is reliable.”
- NERC oversees eight regional reliability entities and encompasses all of the interconnected power systems of the contiguous United States, Canada and a portion of Baja California in Mexico.
- Very strict rules and trade agreements that need to be followed and maintained. There are eight reliability entities within the system which looks at the reliability within each area (8 areas), which is then reported to NERC. 

### NERC High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) ![](../Images/20250508212747.png)
- HVDC stands for High-Voltage Direct Current, which is a method of electric power transmission using direct current (DC) for electric power transmission, in contrast with the more common alternating current (AC) transmission systems. HVDC lines are commonly used for long-distance power transmission since they require fewer conductors and incur less power loss than equivalent AC lines.
- Hydro Quebec sits on its own. It is not synchronized because it only has DC lines going, so it is asynchronously connected to NPCC.
- Similarly, ERCOT connected via dc lines. Same with Quebec and Alberta. They are not synchronized so they need DC connection.
- 26 lines going into US.

### Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC)
- NPCC was formed January 19, 1966, as a successor to the Canada-United States Eastern Interconnection (CANUSE).
- The NPCC occupies the Provinces of Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and the greater New England region of North America, covering all of the States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island. 
- NPCC covers 20% of the Eastern interconnection's total load demand, and 70% of Canada's entire demand. 
- The Hydro-Québec system, which encompasses all of Québec, is commonly considered as part of the Eastern Interconnection even though it technically is its own interconnection. It is tied to rest of the NPCC and Eastern Interconnection through four HVDC ties.

### North American Regional Reliability Councils
- **FRCC: Florida Reliability Coordinating Council
	- The area served by FRCC was previously served by SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC). 
	- The FRCC serves almost all of Florida, with the exception of a portion of the Florida Panhandle below Alabama.
	- It is one of eight Independent System Operators in North American.

- **ERCOT: Electric Reliability Council of Texas 
	- The ERCOT region occupies the entire Texas Interconnection, which occupies nearly all of the state of Texas.
	- It is one of eight Independent System Operators in North American.

- **RFC: Reliability First Corporation
	- The RFC covers territory stretching from the Eastern United States to the lower Great Lakes, covering all of the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and portions of the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky and Virginia.

		- **East Central Area Coordination Agreement (ECAR)** which also formed in 1967
		- **Mid-American Interconnected Network (MAIN)**

- **MRO: Midwest Reliability Organization  
	- The Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO) began operations on January 1, 2005, as the successor to the Mid-continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), which was formed in 1965.
	- MRO covers all of the states of Minnesota, North Dakota and Nebraska, portions of the states of Montana, South Dakota, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba in Canada. 
	- MRO has four of the six HVDC ties which connect the Eastern interconnection to the Western Interconnection, and also has ties to non-NERC systems in Northern Canada. 

- **WECC: Western Electricity Coordinating Council
	- was formed on April 18, 2002, from the merger of the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) which itself was formed on August 14, 1967, the Southwest Regional Transmission Association (SWRTA), and Western Regional Transmission Association (WRTA).
	- The WECC region encompasses the Provinces of British Columbia and Alberta in Canada, and the entire Western Interconnection, which comprises the states of Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, portions of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico and Texas in the United States.

- **SERC: Southeast Electric Reliability Council
	- The SERC occupying most of Southeast North America, serving all of the States of Missouri, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, and portions of Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Florida. 

- SPP: Southwest Power Pool
	- SPP was incorporated as a nonprofit corporation in 1994, and was approved as a Regional Transmission Operator (RTO).
	- The SPP serving all of the State of Kansas, and portions of New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana, Missouri and Nebraska.

- ASCC: Alaska Systems Coordinating Council
	- The ASCC region covers the two grids in the Alaska Interconnection, one of which is in South Central Alaska and the other in the Alaska Panhandle.
	- Neither of the small grids in ASCC has interties to any other interconnection.

- Homeowners are incentivized by saving costs on electricity and potentially earning by producing electricity at homes and selling it back to the grid.

### Smart Meters ![](../Images/20250508220413.png)
- Ontario has made some of the best progress in implementing smart meters, which allows the provision of variable pricing because costs can be adjusted based on the result of metering.
