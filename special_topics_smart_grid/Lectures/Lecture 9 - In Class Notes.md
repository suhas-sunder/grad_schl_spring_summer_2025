### Synchro Phasors and Applications
- Why do we need synchro phasers?
	- Due to the limitations of SCADA
	- SCADA systems have relatively low and slow measurement rates. For example 1 to 4 seconds. 
		- This is not good enough for power systems because the required speed is much faster.
	- SCADA may give phasors but they won't be synchronized. So it's very hard to make sense of the entire power system. Might be able to tell the local info but not overall.
- Phasor measurement units measures the synchronized phasors. The only difference is that the sampling happens in a synchronized fashion.
