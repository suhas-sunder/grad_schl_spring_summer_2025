### Substation Automation

- A big part of substation automation is communication. IED's can communicate. They are at different points of a substation.
- A substation is really a point of connection between various lines that are coming. There could be one bus, two busses, and different architectures. We aren't getting into that but it's good to know. 
	- There might be a transformer between them. Eg. one side could be 230kV and other side is 138 kV. This sits within the substation. Both sides we would take measurements using IEDs.
- Aside from protection and control what else can automated substations do? That's what we will learn today.
	- Can cause issues related to cybersecurity because there is communication within the substation as well as communication to and from outside the substation.
	- What are the various protocols used to communicate between various devices. There are four protocols. Oldest one is Modbus, then DNP3, and modern one is IEC 61870 and then IED 6170 or something.
	- The primary function is really 
		- voltage transformation. 
		- Switching and isolation
		- System protection
		- Control
		- Monitoring and measurements
- Why do we want to automate? This is the main thing.
	- It has several benefits such as reliability (the cornerstone, which is detecting faults and re-routing power), operational efficiency.
	- Fewer site visits so manpower costs get reduced. Efficiency gains are substantial. 
	- Increased safety. Human exposure is minimal so less accidents, arc flash hazards, and other dangerous conditions.
	- Optimized asset management hasn't been used much but it is an area that has become very important.
		- Data can inform maintenance needs well in advance.
		- Predicts problems before it happens so that they can be addressed early. Eg. detects a transformer that is getting hot.
	- In order to implement Smart Grid we need to have automated substation and data gathered in order to control and manage systems/data.
- IT security can't be used with OT security. They have different sets of algorithms and requirements. IT security eg. has time requirements where sampling has to be done within a short interval, so a specific algorithm is needed.
- Look at stages of automation in Lec slides.
