### Algorithms
- One of the major tasks for smart grid is to estimate phasors at diff points in the power systems for voltage and current.
- later on we need to estimate frequency also.
- We will sample voltage and current at regular intervals. This is what most relays do. Usually around 9600 Hz. For a 60hz waveform if you have 4800 hz, you have 80 samples per cycle. We will take all of those 80 samples and based on that make our decision. That will be the design of the algorithm.
- If there is nothing wrong in the system, it is pure 60 Hz. We will get samples at regular intervals. It could be 4800 Hz. It could be 720 Hz. It depends on the requirements.
	- Our goal is to use these samples to compute the phasor.
	- We will use a "window" or number of consecutive samples to conduct a measurement.
	- Every time a new sample comes in, the window shifts forward dropping the old sample at one end and accounting for the new sample at the other end.
- We will be starting with Trig algorithms.
	- Will be computing the real and imaginary parts of the phasor. 
	- **Phasor is only a single frequency. It cannot have multiple frequencies.**
	- We will start with 60Hz phasor but the algorithm can be adapted to any frequency.
	- Seem very simple and are not very good compared to other algorithms, but they do have value and are used in certain situations.
- Next will be Correlation Algorithms.
- Recursive Algorithms.
- modelling Algorithms.
- Make precise measurements quickly.
	- You can't do both things. You can either be precise and slow, or quick and less precise. So we need to make a compromise between precision and speed.
- Generally system frequency components are the required information. Everything else is interference that needs to be removed. 
	- We are only interested in one single frequency. Everything else is interference. 
	- There are exceptions (2nd harmonics, 3rd harmonics).
- Signals are corrupted by DC offsets, decaying DC components, CCVT transients, travelling-wave reflections, and other interferences.
	- It is a challenge to remove these interferences so the data will never be very quick and precise.
	- The data is very limited.
- Samples
	- The numerical representation of the analog input and at any instant. 
	- They come in one at a time.
- Window
	- A window is a collection of consecutive samples.
	- As the new data comes in, the oldest data (sample) in the window is discarded.
- Non-recursive Algorithms
	- Trig, Correlation, and Least error algorithms
	- It means there is no previous information being used. Only the samples accounted for within the window.
	- Recursive algorithms aren't really used in the industry anymore. More for academic purposes.
- Trigonometric Algorithms
	- Features
		- Short window size (< half a cycle of 60Hz). This will depend on the sampling rate. Eg. with 720 Hz we would only have 6 samples, but with 4800 it would be 40 samples.
			- 720 Hz at 60 Hz freq = 720/60 = 12 then take 1/2 = 6 samples
			- 4800 at 60 Hz freq = 4800/60 = 80 then take 1/2 = 40 samples
		- Fast transient response
			- That means they react to changes very quickly.
			- If there is suddenly a change in the magnitued for exxample, these  algroithms will respond to those changes very quickly.
			- They require very few calulations. The amount of calculations are very important
		- Have a bad response for inputs with frequenceis other than the fundamental frequency.
			- The preciseness goes down if frequencies come in that don't match the fundamental frequency.
	- Algorithms
		- Mickey... (look at notes)
	- Assumptions
		- The waveform of the signal is sinusoidal for the nominal frequency. A pure sine wave and nothing else.
		- The frequency of the signal is invariant. Meaning, the frequency does not change over time. 
			- Except when the generator is started up, it is brought up to 60Hz after and then synchronized. This doesn't matter as long as the freq doesn't change.
	- Basics
		- Let a voltage be 
			- v = Vp sin(wt + theta)
				- omega = frequency (known to us 60Hz or w/e)
				- Vp = Magnitude of the phasor that we calculate
				- Theta = Angle
			- The first and second derivatives of this voltage
			-  Taking the squares of v (only using 1st derivative) look at notes
			- Taking the squares of v (using 1st derivative and 2nd) look at notes
		- Miki and Mikano Algorithm
			- The window size is only two samples.
			- Assume within that window where time is 0. In the diagram the prof assumes the latest time is 0. If it was the other way around, the result would change, but it is still valid.
			- Algorithm
				- At time t = 0
				- what is Vp sin(theta)
				- Very good for pure 60Hz, however it's not a great algorithm overall. It does not perform well outside of 60Hz.
				- Each phasor comes shifted at whatever angle the window shifts at. So if it is sampling at 30 deg then each time we sample the angle shifts 30 deg.
				- Digital filters are in digital form that extract a certain frequency component out of the signal. Used extensively in engineering field and also other fields like finance.
				- We designed two digital filters to extract the real and imaginary parts of the digital signal.
				- Coefficients are the one that determine how the digital filter will respond. V0 and V-1.
			- Frequency response of the filters
				- Assumptions
					- Nominal Frequency = 60Hz
					- look at slides
				- Brush up on Z transforms
				- Magnitude is more important for us right now compared to phase response to see how the filter behaves.
				- This filter isn't great based on the magnitude because the signal will be amplified once we go past 60Hz. So it is very good if you have a pure sin wave. Most of the time the waveforms are pure, so there won't be an issue most of the time. However, it won't work well when there is a disturbance.
				- The graph that shows everything with a magnitude 1 and phase response of 0 means it will pass any value without filtering it. 
				- IED (integrated electronic devices or something) devices show a phasor rotating on the screen. You can see the phasors rotating at any time.
			- Advantags
				- Very fast transient response time
				- Very few calculations are required
			- Disadvantages
				- Noise affects performance
				- Performance of harmonics has adverse  effects
				- Decaying DC affects performance
