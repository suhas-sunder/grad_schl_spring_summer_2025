### Project
- 20% of final marks
- No marks for project proposal. Prof will check if it is good
	- One page
	- What is the idea? What are we planning to implement.
	- If proposal is revised and re-submitted it is 5% of the final project.
- Prof will modify the pages. Eg. proposal will be max 2 pgs.
- Demo will likely be 15 mins + 5 mins for QA.
- Work should have value.
	- Final project should have good findings or be good enough to publish as a final paper to submit to a conference.

### IoT Sensors
- Filtering capabilities
	- If data is useful keep it, otherwise filter out unnecessary information.
- Interrupt handling
	- Program a controller or device to perform a certain task based on a threshold.
	- It interrupts the processor that is doing a certain task as soon as something important happens.
		- Eg. a sensor that keeps sensing the temperature until a certain threshold is crossed. Once this happens, the  normal processes are stopped and AC is turned on.
