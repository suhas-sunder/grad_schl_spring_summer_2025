### Presentation
- Deadline for submission documents is end of day of July 08 for us.
- 15 minutes for presentation. 
	- Reading material. Book chapters.
	- Papers
	- Tools and implementations

### Project
-  Any reference older than 10 years is not allowed. Anything before 2015 is not good.
	- Any paper from IEEE, ACM, Springer or has some citations are valid.
- Any good paper we find should have a threat to validity or information about limitations on the problem.
- Check if mathematical model can be found in existing implementation.
	- Justify why the function was used.
	- Usually models are solving simplification of reality and skip processes that are complex to represent in a mathematical model.
- Should explain why the implementation is memetic as opposed to generic GA hybrid.
- See if we can generate a topographical map for our problem.
### Project ideas
- Find ways to extend lifespan of batteries
	- Better cooling
- Three topics with three papers.


### Why design efficient optimization algorithms?
- Problem landscape
	- Visual idea about the quality of problem we are looking into. 
	- Gives an idea of the shape or topology of objective function being optimized.
	- Looking at the landscape, we can decide how to tackle the problem.
		- Eg. wouldn't use rugged, multimodal for optimizing solar panels because they are smooth and convex.
	- If you know  the shape of the problem landscape, you can immediately tell which one is easier or harder to solve based on the shape. 
		- Eg. if it is very rugged/bumpy then it's harder to solve, but a smooth terrain is likely much simpler.
- Benchmark checks the baseline to tell which algorithm is performing better or worse based on the scenario.
